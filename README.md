# Employee-tracker

 The challenge in this project was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this application won’t be deployed, a walkthrough video is to be created that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. A link to the video is to be submitted and added to the README of the project.

# 1) The user story for the project was:

AS A business owner

I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company

SO THAT I can organize and plan my business


# 2) The Acceptance criteria for the project was:

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I start the application

THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role

WHEN I choose to view all departments

THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids

WHEN I choose to view all roles

THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role

WHEN I choose to view all employees

THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to

WHEN I choose to add a department

THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database

WHEN I choose to add a role

THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database

WHEN I choose to add an employee

THEN I am prompted to enter the employee’s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database

WHEN I choose to update an employee role
